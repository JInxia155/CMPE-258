Handwritten Digits Recognition

    Submission Channel:

CANVAS

    Submission file format and the material

(3.1) Zip file;

(3.2) your python code/programs and all necessary photos if needed to verify your code;

(3.3) readme.txt to clear define the steps to execute your program;

(3.4) 5 seconds video clips to show the execution result.

    Project requirements:

(4.1) Input live video or video testing file;

(4.2) Perform pre-processing Computer Vision functions to localize the ROI (region of interests). Each digits should be identified as one separated ROI. You should have written 4 digits, so you should have 4 separate ROIs;

(4.3) Draw bounding box for each ROI;

(4.4) Perform processing task to read each ROI as a new image, and compute its aspect ratio (Width vs. Height), and form a new square image with the bigger value of either width or height;

(4.5) resize the square image to 28 x 28 and convert it to grey scale;

(4.6) use the sample code given in the class to identify the digit, and

(4.7) for each identify the digits, plot a caption (text) by the bounding box and show the detection result.

5. This project counts 10 points.
